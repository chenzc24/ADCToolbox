"""ADC behavioral models — forward operators (vin → codes).

Distinct from ``siggen`` (which generates analog test signals **before**
the ADC) and from ``dout``/``spectrum`` (which **analyze** code streams).
These are the discrete-time conversion models themselves.

Currently includes:
    - SAR (binary or sub-radix-2, optional cap mismatch + comparator noise)

Convention (matches Arcadia-1/SpecMind reference):
    vin     ∈ [0, 1]   normalized unipolar input (mid-rail = 0.5)
    weights are normalized by sum(bit_weights) + 1 LSB
    codes   ∈ {0, 1}^B, MSB at index 0
    recon   = codes @ digital_weights
